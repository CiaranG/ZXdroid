Welcome to ZXdroid - ZX Spectrum Emulator for Android platform by Dmitry Rodin, based on FUSE (the Free Unix Spectrum Emulator) by Philip Kenall.

This emulator can run ZX Spectrum games and applications in various file formats: tapes, snapshots, cartridges & disks. Lots of them you can find at www.worldofspectrum.com in the Archive directory. Download game files and place them on your SD Card.

To get started push 'Menu' button on your phone.

To run a game you have to load its file through 'Menu' > 'Load file'.

If you want to save your current state during the game process, you can do it in 'Menu' > 'Save snapshot'

If your game file doesn't load automatically for some reasons, you can select the Spectrum model under 'Menu' > 'Select machine' and then try to load it once more.

There are two types of controls: on screen touch controls, and hardware keys controls, you can use one of them or combine both.

To switch on screen controls: touch spectrum screen and select appropriate type, or go to 'Menu' > 'On screen controls' and select preferred type there.

To define hardware keys to match some spectrum keys go to 'Menu' > 'Define keys'. You can intercept 'Menu' and 'Back' hardware keys as well, in this case you have to touch spectrum screen to access menu.

If you have trackball it will acts as Dpad you can adjust its sensitivity in the 'Menu' > 'Trackball sensitivity'.

ZXdroid can play spectrum sounds and music, but this feature disabled by default, as it can lead to perfomance downgrade, to enable sound switch 'Menu' > 'Enable sounds'.

If you have problems with perfomance and sound is disabled, you can try to switch skipping of the frames in 'Menu' > 'Skip frames' or disable 'Smooth scaling' under the video options category there.
